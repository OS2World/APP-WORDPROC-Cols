The program cols is written to allow to print ASCII text in several
columns without loosing any information. Lines which don't fit in
one column are broken and overlapping text is taken to the next
line. It is possible to break the text between words only.

This program understands some comand line parameters. Type 
cols -h for more information.

If you want to use the compiled version of this program you must have
the EMX-GCC dll's (version 0.8h or above) installed. Because I don't
have any other compiler, I was't able to test if it possible to 
use ICC or BCC but the program isn't very long and was compiled on
several un*x machines without any problem.
